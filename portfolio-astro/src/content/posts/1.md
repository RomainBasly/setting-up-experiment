When building web projects, choosing the right framework can make a significant difference in performance and development experience. Tools like React, Next.js, and Astro each bring unique strengths to the table, but how do they stack up when applied to the same use case? To answer this, I decided to conduct a straightforward experiment: building identical portfolio projects using these three frameworks and comparing their performance, build times, and developer experience.

## More is less - complexity out of simplicity

As web developers, we’re all familiar with how a webpage looks: it’s made of a basic HTML, styled with CSS to look nice, and includes interactive elements. In fact, **these elements are basic**. However, on top of these « simple » elements, frameworks were created to make something dynamic, user-friendly, modern, and even simplify the lives of developers. However, some argue that these frameworks, in return, introduce **unnecessary complexity and waste resources**, especially for smaller projects. As our fundamental philosophy is 'Do not trust, verify,' that is what we intend to do in these first articles. To verify that, we have created this portfolio in three different methods: using traditional react, then using nextJS and finally Astro.

## Okay bro, but what’s special about Astro compared to React and Next.js?
Astro sets itself apart from NextJS by taking an even lighter approach to client-side JavaScript. The team designed the framework for content-driven websites like blogs, marketing pages, and e-commerce stores. In one word: websites that are mostly static. Astro’s key promise is to reduce JavaScript overhead and complexity compared to frameworks like React or Next.js.

## What does Astro promise?
1. **Faster Page Loads**: Astro’s goal is to reach users as quickly as possible by **reducing** the amount of JavaScript that **runs on the client**. Instead of sending a heavy bundle of JavaScript (the entire app), Astro sends **minimal JavaScript** or none at all for static content.
2. **Astro’s 'island architecture'** allows for partial **hydration**, meaning **only the interactive parts** of the page use JavaScript, while static content remains untouched. This is a major difference from frameworks like React in SSR, which hydrate the entire page, adding interactivity to all parts of the HTML, even those that remain static. By hydrating only the necessary parts, Astro reduces client-side JavaScript overhead, leading to **faster performance** for content-driven sites.
3. **SEO Benefits**: Because Astro sends fully-rendered HTML from the server, search engines can crawl your content more easily, which **improves SEO** just like NextJS. You can still add interactivity when needed, but Astro focuses on delivering HTML first.
4. **Developer Simplicity**: Astro simplifies development by **allowing you** to write components in basic HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, while also supporting frameworks like **React, Vue, and Svelte**. It acts as a **meta-framework**, meaning you can reuse your existing knowledge and libraries within Astro without needing to learn a new way of thinking.

These promises sound great, but how do they hold up in practice? In the next article, we will evaluate the three frameworks from several angles: the time it takes to set up a project, the initial size, bundle size, and loading times for users.
